# opentelemetry-php

Welcome to the opentelemetry-php repository.  We will be updating this repository with the initial implementation.

Our meetings are held weekly on Wednesdays at 10:30am PST / 1:30pm EST.  Please reach out on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/community) if you'd like to be invited.  The public calendar invite will be shared once it becomes avaiable.

Our gitter chat room can be found here: [opentelemetry-php gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php)

Meeting Agenda / Notes will be housed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLDZGLY24rk5fRudjdQAcx_u81ZQWCF3zxiNT-sz7DI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Examples

You can use the [examples/ExampleTrace.php](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/tree/master/examples/exampleTrace.php) file to test out the reference implementation we have.  This can be easily executed with docker by running `./resources/example-using-docker` from the root of the repository.

### Tests

Our unit and integration tests live in the `tests/` folder.  You can use our docker test runner by running `./resources/test-using-docker` from the root of the repository.
